How does LSTM work?
At first we should be aware of not to run all of these code because of a crash. Some parameters are too high for our processors
to be able to run, in fact they possibly exceed our memory size and lead to crash. The point we noticed was that if we feed the 
data randomly we'll have different results, so we won't be able to compare the results of changed programs.
